| Aspect                  | **OSI Model**                                                                                                                    | **TCP/IP Model**                                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Full Form**           | Open Systems Interconnection Model                                                                                               | Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol Model                                            |
| **Layers**              | 7 Layers: <br>1. Physical <br>2. Data Link <br>3. Network <br>4. Transport <br>5. Session <br>6. Presentation <br>7. Application | 4 Layers: <br>1. Network Access <br>2. Internet <br>3. Transport <br>4. Application                |
| **Development**         | Developed by **ISO** (International Standards Organization) in 1977                                                              | Developed by **DARPA** (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) in 1970s                        |
| **Purpose**             | General, theoretical model to understand and design networks                                                                     | Practical implementation model for the internet                                                    |
| **Approach**            | Layered approach â€“ Each layer has **strictly defined roles**                                                                     | More flexible â€“ Combines multiple OSI layers into fewer layers                                     |
| **Application Support** | Has separate layers for **Application, Presentation, and Session**                                                               | Merges all three into a **single Application Layer**                                               |
| **Transport Layer**     | Provides **connection-oriented (TCP)** and **connectionless (UDP)** communication                                                | Same â€“ but only two protocols used: **TCP & UDP**                                                  |
| **Network Layer**       | Uses IP addressing, routing, and logical addressing                                                                              | Called **Internet Layer**, equivalent to OSI Network Layer                                         |
| **Data Flow Unit**      | - Physical: Bits <br>- Data Link: Frames <br>- Network: Packets <br>- Transport: Segments <br>- Upper Layers: Data               | - Network Access: Frames <br>- Internet: Packets <br>- Transport: Segments <br>- Application: Data |
| **Error Handling**      | Handled in **Data Link** and **Transport** layers                                                                                | Handled only in **Transport Layer**                                                                |
| **Flexibility**         | Rigid, theoretical, not used directly in real networks                                                                           | Practical, widely used in **real-world networking**                                                |
| **Protocols Used**      | Protocol examples: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, TLS/SSL, IP, ARP, Ethernet, etc.                                                             | Protocol stack: TCP, UDP, IP, ICMP, ARP, HTTP, FTP, DNS, etc.                                      |
| **Best Used For**       | Understanding and teaching networking concepts                                                                                   | Real-world network communication (Internet)                                                        |
| **Main Advantage**      | Clear separation of concerns, easy to study                                                                                      | Simpler, directly maps to internet protocols                                                       |
| **Main Limitation**     | Theoretical, not practical for real implementation                                                                               | Lacks separate Presentation & Session layers, less modular                                         |
