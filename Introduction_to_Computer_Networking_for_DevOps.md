# Networking in DevOps
Networking in DevOps is the practice of designing, configuring, automating, and monitoring the connectivity between systems, services, and environments so that applications can communicate reliably, securely, and efficiently throughout the software delivery lifecycle. It encompasses fundamentals like IP addressing, routing, DNS, load balancing, firewalls, and TLS; cloud constructs such as VPCs/VNets, subnets, NAT, peering, and private endpoints; and platform layers including container/Kubernetes networking, service discovery, and network policies. Its goal is to enable scalable architectures, enforce security and compliance, support CI/CD pipelines, and reduce incident risk by ensuring predictable, observable, and resilient service-to-service communication.

# How Internets Works 
- The Internet Works by connecting millions of devices worldwide through a system of network .
-  when you request a website your device sends data and passes through routers .
-  And DNS (Domain Name System ) to locate the server and the server responds with the requested data using protocols like TCP/IP
