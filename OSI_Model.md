# OSI MODEL WITH DETAILS 

## What is OSI Model 
- OSI model stands for open system interconnection
- OSI Model is a way to explain how computers talk to each other over the network by breaking the process into seven simple steps or called layer.

## 7 Layer in Depth 
1. Application Layer :
- The Applications Layer of OSI model is the top layer in this model and takes care of network communication .
- This Application layer provides the functionality to send and receive data from users
  - What it does:
     - Interface directly with user software
     - Provides service like eamil,web browsers file transfer
- Protocol :
   - HTTPS, HTTP,FTP, SMTP,DNS
- eg :
   - You type www.youtube.com in your browser
   - Then Browse (Application Layer Software) creates on HTTP/HTTPS request asking for youtube  
2. Presentation Layer (Layer 6) :
- Translate data into a formal the application can understand
- Presentation layer is responsible for translation encryption and compression of data.
    - what is does:
      - Data translation
      - Data Compress (reduce the size for transmission )
      - Data encryption / Decryption (SSL/TLS)
- eg:
    - When you vist on HTTPS website , encryption & decryption happens here.
